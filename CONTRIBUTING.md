## Basics

If you are new to open source or git, be sure to read Github's handy [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) overview.

## Branches and Tags

Here's how the repository is organized:

- Releases are identified by tags (e.g. v1.0.0)
- The master branh always contains the latest production ready release.
- New (and maintained legacy) x.0.0 versions exist within named branches.
- New features should be developed in feature branches from master (or the version being modified)
